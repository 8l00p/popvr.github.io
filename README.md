# popvr.github.io



Just trying to put together something with A-Frame. 

All models created by me in Magica Voxel exept the T-Rex, which came as a default in Magica Voxel and have only made small
changes on it. 

All the models are Obj's with baked textures which reduces the file size.

Took a lot of reference from the a-frame.io and its pages on github. 

If you want to then please feel free to take all or any of the elements to make something. 

Main aim was to make it a comfortable WebVR experience which loads up quickly as well. However, i am planning to add more details to this scene, sought of a western for Robots and Dino's, now and then having shootouts. 
But obviously it all depends on time, made this in only fews days during the holidays.
